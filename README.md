# Zany80

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zany80/Oryolized.svg?branch=master "Build status from Travis CI")

Zany80 is a plugin-based Fantasy Console. It is a piece of software that
emulates a game system that never existed. It also includes tools to make
creation of games for the system easier.

Warning: this is still in alpha status. It is far from complete, and this build
doesn't yet - well, function.
