# Zany80

Zany80 is an IDE to make working with various pieces of hardware easier, tightly
integrating various emulators with debuggers and an intelligent code editor. It
also provides tools to ease developments of various types of software (port
monitors, sprite editors, etc).

As of version 0.2, Zany80 also includes support for a second system based on the
[LIMN architecture](https://github.com/limnarch), and a fully function toolchain
for the associated DragonFruit language.

There was once a webapp, compiled to emscripten. I am unwilling to deal
with the maintainance burden of supporting webapp bullshit, so unless
someone else does it, it will not happen.
