# Zany80

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zany80/Zany80.svg?branch=master "Build status from Travis CI")

Zany80 is a plugin-based Fantasy Console. It is a piece of software that
emulates a game system that never existed. It also includes tools to make
creation of games for the system easier.

As of version 0.2, Zany80 also includes support for a second system based on the
[LIMN architecture](https://github.com/limnarch), and a fully function toolchain
for the associated DragonFruit language.

There was once a webapp, compiled to emscripten. I am unwilling to deal
with the maintainance burden of supporting webapp bullshit, so unless
someone else does it it will not happen.
